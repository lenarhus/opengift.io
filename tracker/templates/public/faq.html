                                    We plan to implement it in several phases. <br/><br/>
                                    In first phase we shall focus on accumulating on our platform as many good OSS
                                    projects as possible. In parallel, we’ll work closely with projects that have
                                    highest potential to become fundable by sponsors. This work may include assistance
                                    in search of potential contributors, promoters and field experts, preparing
                                    case-studies of OSS use, and direct sale of OSS to enterprises and funds. <br/><br/>
                                    The first phase to take 8-10 months; upon completion we expect to have no less than
                                    500 projects and 4-5 OpenGift champions, which raise more than $100K each.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    Once we have enough projects and several success stories, we can switch the main
                                    direction of our activity to attracting sponsors. On initial phases we aim to offer
                                    personalized solutions to corporate sponsors and partner with organizations that
                                    have an expertise to provide similar services.<br/><br/>
                                    By the end of this phase we expect no less than 100 projects to start earning above
                                    $300K on annual basis.<br/><br/>
                                    More projects become sufficiently funded, more interesting the platform become to
                                    early investors. So on third step we will make a heavy marketing emphasize on
                                    attracting business angels and seed funds. By doing so, we effectively scale up the
                                    project: early-stage financing will help a lot of OSS to grow faster, and, as an
                                    effect, it will attract more projects and sponsors to our platform. It will also
                                    attract system participants that are not directly involved in software development:
                                    project and product managers, technical writers, marketers, etc. With their input
                                    OSS project teams will be able to provide a level of customization and service close
                                    to those of proprietary providers.

                                        <li>You can use tokens to build up your team. Our vision is to create an ecosystem, where you could use tokens to get somebody to provide supporting services for your software, or to run a marketing campaign or to write technical documentation.  Whatever work you wish to delegate. True, now you can promise to give a share of future donations in exchange of work/service – but many of your potential teammates would prefer to get some sort of guarantee. That’s exactly what smart-contracts are needed for.</li>
                                        <li>You can collect donations in cryptocurrancies.  Neither you, nor your backers need to pay banks/payment systems fees. We’ll also make sure that buy-sell spreads for the internal currency (GIFTs) are low, and projects can exchange GIFTs for fiat easily and safely</li>

                                        <li>Currently, you can get some rough estimations on a basis of other platforms data (either for yours or similar projects). For example, if I were investor, I would happily fund any OS project that yields me, let’s say, 10% annual return. Let’s suppose there is a project that collects $50K a year in donations. Then, for 10% of its tokens I’d offer $50K.
<br />Of course, the tricky thing is to learn what profits your potential investor really expects. But, after all, it’s market: a potential profit okey for one investor may look ridiculous for another one.</li>
                                        <li>Soon you and you potential investors will be able to use OpenGift to collect data on project progress, problems it’s going to solve, team background, amount of downloads etc. All this data can be used to forecast potential ROI.</li>

                                    At first stage we obviously be competing with other solutions for OSS monetization
                                    like Open Collective, FundRequest, Patreon, BountySource.
                                    Later on, at “grown-up” phase, we believe our main competitors will be traditional
                                    software development companies (especially companies that provide offshore
                                    development services). <br/><br/>

                                            changes in platforms functionality and freelance business model)
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Providers of different types of software constructors designed to eliminate
                                            coding (coopetition model and market segmentation seem more probable)
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Traditional crowdinvesting platforms (to some extent; most people will
                                            probably invest in both opensource and traditional companies for
                                            diversification purpose)

                                    OpenSource project are essentially teams that work together for some time, which
                                    helps to save up time usually spent on coordination.<br/><br/>
                                    Needless to say, all these count when working on big projects that are based on
                                    OpenSource software. Hence we believe that OpenSource model is better suited for
                                    more complex projects that those typical for freelance.

                                    With OpenGift you’ll have some extra motivation. First, you can make a OSS project
                                    to reconsider their development plans. You may need it when you need a specific
                                    feature in software you got used to, or when you haven’t find an existing solution
                                    to your software-related problem.<br/><br/>
                                    Second, taken together all the small opensource projects help to overcome major
                                    technological barriers and solve problems that seem to be far away from IT. Our
                                    technological map make the role of each project more evident. So even if you don’t
                                    concern yourself with opensource, you may want to check the map from time to time –
                                    may be you’ll find something that you deem really important.

                                    It may happen. To protect yourself, take a closer look to a project’s profile page.
                                    How many tasks has the project already finished? How large is its community?
                                    How many contributors/commits it has? All those data constitutes a reputation of a
                                    project.
                                    More effort a project invested in building reputation, more it has to lose when
                                    defrauding its backers.
